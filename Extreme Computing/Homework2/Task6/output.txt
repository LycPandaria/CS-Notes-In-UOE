the short term other than making OOP purists assuming you mean exposing properties that would otherwise use obviously a big difference if you leave ALL your attributes the there are a few really good reasons for doing it allows you to validate input at its source instead of later having to the origin with a combination of hardware breakpoints and weight must fall in mWeight also allows you to later change the behavior of your object without needing to refactor client mThing turns out we need to recalc a few things when this
reason is that floating point numbers are not a real representation of the number that you save in the to BCD coded can see the definition Point the problem is that certain numbers are not expressable with a given set of could if you could add bits trick is that in most cases the difference between the saved number and the intended number are pretty In you have some corner cases where this may lead to is for example the reason why you should not build a financial software and use floating point numbers for money You can easily have differences that are which your tax office to compare floating point numbers you should always apply some kind of threshhold that is ok for your Something As David Mentioned in his you will still get into trouble with things like you can at least store numbers without loss in precision that you put into the As computers have limited memory you can always construct corner cases where you rely on exact saw your edit of the so here is the next somehow because you know whether just the number representation that is wrong or if just a real value that is close to It really depends on the requirements for your If a small error is then not then you have to use another variable type that is not suffering from the
